# The Newer Language

(todo: fluff/introduction, probably give a name to the language)

As stated by muddyfish, a newer compiler was made to be more high-leveled than COGOL. So here I will show you some of the features of this language.

### Operators

First up, this language has custom operators. A file containing some of the standard operators has been created called `stdint.txt`. This can be included in a [language-name] program using `#include stdint`. Now this list of operators do not jsut contain direct translations to opcodes (`+` to `__ADD__`) but also more complex ones such as operators for multiplication and modulo (both of which are not QFTASM opcodes). Additionally, one can use the opcodes directly by using `__OPCODENAME__`.

### Types

This language has both ints and bools, and arrays are yet to be implemented completely.
