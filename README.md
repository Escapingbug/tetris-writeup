# WriteUp
A place to draft the answers for the tetris PPCG challenge

Here's the overall plan: we are going to split the content across multiple answers, structured like one large multi-part answer.  We will organize the contents so that each anwerer gets the opportunity to talk more-or-less about the parts of the project that they were most involved in.  We will decide a presentation order and then post our answers in that order so that they remain in order when sorted by oldest.

Current Presentation Order
-

1. PhiNotPi (probably CW)
    - Overview
    - The tetris game
2. El'endia Starman
    - Some basic metapixel stuff
    - Varlife
    - Simple logic gates and wires
3. K Zhang
    - computer hardware (multiplexor, RAM, ROM, etc.)
4. PhiNotPi
    - QFTASM
    - Cogol
4. Muddyfish
    - new language and compiler
5. ? kritixi lithos
    - more new language stuff
6. Mego
    - Conversion to GoL
    - More metapixel stuff
    - Future directions
7. ? quartata
    - LLVM

Rough list of topics
-

From this list we need to develop an ordering that allows us to divide the material between different users.  It is okay if one topic gets split between adjacent answers.

 - Previous related works (see: wireworld computer)
 - Metapixels, varlife
 - Wires, logic gates, simple structures, etc.
 - Processor architecture, QFTASM and its interpreter
 - Complex logic circuits, including everything up to the computer hardware
 - Cogol and its compiler
 - The newer QFT language and its compiler
 - The Tetris program itself
 - The generation of the final GoL file, all the way from the assembly to the ROM and from VarLife to GoL
 - Future directions
 - LLVM backend (Quartata will probably post an answer on this sometime afterwards when it is complete)
