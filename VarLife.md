The [OTCA Metapixel](http://www.conwaylife.com/w/index.php?title=OTCA_metapixel) is a construct in Conway's Game of Life that can be used to simulate any Life-like cellular automata. As the LifeWiki (linked above) says,

> The OTCA metapixel is a 2048 Ã— 2048 period 35328 unit cell that was constructed by Brice Due... It has many advantages...including the ability to emulate any Life-like cellular automaton and the fact that, when zoomed out, the ON and OFF cells are easy to distinguish...

What [Life-like cellular automata](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton#Life-like_cellular_automata) means here is essentially that cells are born and cells survive according to how many of their eight neighbor cells are alive. The syntax for these rules is as follows: a B followed by the numbers of live neighbors that will cause a birth, then a slash, then an S followed by the numbers of live neighbors that will keep the cell alive. A bit wordy, so I think an example will help. The canonical Game of Life can be represented by the rule B23/S3, which says that any dead cell with two or three live neighbors will become alive and any live cell with three neighbors will remain alive. Otherwise, the cell dies.

## VarLife

I built an online simulator of Life-like rules where you could make any cell behave according to any life-like rule and called it "Variations of Life". This name has been shortened to "VarLife" to be more concise. Here's a screenshot of it (link to it here: http://play.starmaninnovations.com/varlife/BeeHkfCpNR):

Notable features:
 - Toggle cells between live/dead and paint the board with different rules.
 - The ability to start and stop the simulation, and to do one step at a time. It's also possible to do a given number of steps as fast as possible or more slowly, at the rate set in the ticks-per-second and milliseconds-per-tick boxes.
 - Clear all live cells or to entirely reset the board to a blank state.
 - Can change the cell and board sizes, and also to enable toroidal wrapping horizontally and/or vertically.
 - Permalinks (which encode all information in the url) and short urls (because sometimes there's just too much info, but they're nice anyway).
 - Rule sets, with B/S specification, colors, and optional randomness.
 - And last but definitely not least, rendering gifs!

The render-to-gif feature is my favorite both because it took a ton of work to implement, so it was really satisfying when I finally cracked it at 7 in the morning, and it makes it very easy to share VarLife constructs with others.

## Basic VarLife Circuitry

All in all, the VarLife computer only needs four cell types! Eight states in all counting the dead/alive states. They are:
 - B/S (black/white), which serves as a buffer between all components since B/S cells can never be alive.
 - B1/S (blue/cyan), which is the main cell type used to propagate signals.
 - B2/S (green/yellow), which is mainly used for signal control, ensuring it doesn't backpropagate.
 - B12/S1 (red/orange), which is used in a few specialized situations, such as crossing signals and storing a bit of data.

### Wires

There are a few different wire designs with varying characteristics.

This is the easiest and most basic wire in VarLife. Simply a strip of blue bordered by strips of green.

This wire is unidirectional. That is, it will kill any signal attempting to travel in the opposite direction. It's also one cell narrower than the basic wire.

Diagonal wires also exist but they are not used much at all.
